Stairs and slabs are one of the most often-requested features of the [NodeCore](/packages/Warr1024/nodecore/) game, even though they didn't fit the game themes/mechanics and had to be removed from a very early version.  This mod adds them back in as an optional feature, in a uniquely Nodecorian way.

Stairs/slabs are defined for:

* Wooden Planks
* Cobble
* Bonded Bricks (of various types)
* Lode Cubes (but not Glowing)
* Chromatic Glass

To craft stairs or slabs:

* Build the shape of the stairs or slab in a 2x2x2 space, only these 2 basic shapes are currently supported.  You must use only one of the supported materials and cannot mix them.
* Make sure you have nothing else but air, and the flat work surface you're building the stair/slab unit on, in the space or surrounding that 2x2x2 space.
* Place an eggcorn on top of one of the base nodes (i.e. for stairs, on the bottom step, not the top).
* Use a mallet to mash the eggcorn and glue the nodes together into a unit.

Stairs and slabs can be recycled by chopping them apart with a hatchet.
